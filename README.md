I'm a Frontend Web Developer for Altice Labs in Aveiro, Portugal.
I'm confident, naturally curious and I'm easily inspired, by me and by others, to follow my thoughts wherever they take me.
I don't like to define myself by the work I've done. I define myself by the work I want to do.
Skills can be taught butâ€¦ I prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself and do interesting things that matter, one line of code at the time.
My interest in the React ecosystem led me to work in some personal projects that you can see in my repositories.

I have always one thought in my head:

'To have results above the average, we have to do what the average doesn't'
